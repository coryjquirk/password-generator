## How to Use

Hit the red Generate Password button to start the program.

The program will ask you how many characters you would like in your password (minimum 8 characters, maximum 128 characters). Then it will ask you if you want Numbers, Symbols, Upper Case letters, and Lower Case letters. The result will be a string of characters of your desired length.

Copy the generated password to use.

Refresh the page before generating a new password.

If you fail to select at least one of the character categories, you will be prompted to start over again. Additionally, if you enter no character length or a character length outside of 8-128, you will be asked to try again. Hit the Generate Password button to begin anew. 

## Installation
